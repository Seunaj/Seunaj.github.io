title: "Real-time Dehydration Monitoring Using Off-the-shelf sensor-based System"
excerpt: "We developed a sensor-based health-monitoring system to observe the sweat rate using sensors. We used off-the-shelf and at-hand sensors to build our sweat-measuring system. One of the key reasons for using off-the-shelf sensors is to make the system available for DIY users and introduce it to the K 12 level students.<br/><img src='/images/project1.png' width='500' height='300'>"

During exercise, the core body temperature rises since 70-90% of metabolic energy is released as heat. As the body temperature rises, the body depends on an evaporative heat loss mechanism to balance the increased heat. Therefore, sweat is produced as it helps the body maintain a comfortable temperature. However, as sweat evaporates from the body, besides reducing body temperature it causes loss of body fluid. Thus, intense exercise may cause dehydration if the lost body fluid is not replaced by enough water intake. If exercise is continued while dehydrated, body temperature will keep rising since the body will not be able to produce enough sweat. This sudden rise in body temperature may lead to different heat-related body issues such as heat stroke. Thus, the goal of this project is to detect the body temperature and sweat rate to predict the dehydration state and notify the user.
