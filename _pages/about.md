Hi, this is Oluwaseun Ajayi, a Ph.D student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT)](https://www.iit.edu/) since Spring 2021, advised by [Prof. Yu Cheng](http://www.ece.iit.edu/~yucheng/). My research focuses on machine learning in wireless networks, information freshness optimization, and big data analytics. I obtained the BSc. Telecommunication Science degree from the University of Ilorin, Nigeria, and worked as a Graduate Assistant in the Department of Electrical and Information Engineering at Covenant University, Nigeria, before joining IIT as a Ph.D student in January 2021.
