I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu) and a part of the [Cyber-Physical Systems Security Lab](https://csslab.uta.edu) led by [Dr. Habeeb Olufowobi](https://dipupo.github.io). My research focuses on the problem of understanding the security challenges posed by the susceptibility of connected vehicles to potential malicious cyberattacks from the operating environment. The critical problem I try to solve in this area involves correctly modeling the interaction of connected vehicles and detecting anomalous events using robust, scalable, and secured machine learning algorithms.
